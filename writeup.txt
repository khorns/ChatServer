2. Timer is implemented by not perfect. The known issue in which I don't know how to fix is decementing time individual participant and observer. The concept is straight forward, but I have worked on the problem for more than 6 hours.

The current behaviour would be once an observer/participant connects, they have a 60 secs time to enter their username. They would get a time reset to 60 secs again if somebody who is already connect the server is interacting with it.

3. Nothing is fancy when come to testing this program. One terminal run the server while have a few more terminal run the participants and obsersers.

4. The most challenging aspect of the program is following all the specified protocol and implementing timer.
